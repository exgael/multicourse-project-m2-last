Sony Xperia 1 V Review: For the Purists

The Sony Xperia 1 V (XQ-DQ72) is not for everyone, and that is exactly how Sony likes it. Targeted squarely at content creators and pro-gamers, this device refuses to follow modern trends. It keeps the 3.5mm headphone jack and the shutter button, features that have long vanished elsewhere.

The screen is a 4K HDR OLED panel with a 21:9 aspect ratio, making it perfect for cinematic content and gaming, although it's a bit tall for one-handed use. The refresh rate is a smooth 120Hz.

Powering this beast is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform, paired with 12GB of RAM. Note that while the Gen 3 is out now, this review unit runs the Gen 2 efficiently without the overheating issues of the previous Mark IV model. 

The battery is a standard 5000 mAh unit. The main camera is a 48MP Exmor T sensor, specifically designed for low light. It supports 5G connectivity and features a unique textured back for grip.

Priced at €1,399, it is a hard sell for the average consumer, but for photography enthusiasts and audiophiles, it offers a toolset that no other smartphone provides.
