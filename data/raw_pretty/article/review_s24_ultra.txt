REVIEW: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra - The King of Android?
Date: January 24, 2024

Samsung has finally unveiled its latest titan, the Galaxy S24 Ultra (Model SM-S928B/DS), and it is nothing short of a powerhouse. Moving away from the curved screens of the past, this year's model features a flat 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a peak brightness of 2600 nits and a 120Hz refresh rate.

Under the hood, the device is powered by the "Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy", a slightly overclocked version of Qualcomm's latest chipset. This ensures that the 12GB of RAM works seamlessly during intense multitasking. Unlike the iPhone 15 Pro Max which uses the A17 Pro, Samsung sticks to its partnership with Qualcomm for all global markets this time.

The camera system is headlined by a staggering 200MP main sensor (f/1.7 aperture). While some might prefer the color science of the Pixel 8 Pro, the detail here is unmatched. It also sports a 50MP periscope telephoto lens. 

Battery life is solid with a 5000 mAh cell, supporting 45W wired charging. It ships with Android 14 and One UI 6.1.

The price remains a sticking point. In the US it launches at $1,299, while European customers are looking at a starting price of roughly 1449 EUR for the base 256GB storage model. Despite the cost, for power users, this is the definitive smartphone of 2024.
