Hands-on with the Google Pixel 8a: The Mid-Range Champion

Google continues to redefine what a budget phone can be. The Pixel 8a (Model G6GPR) arrives just months after its flagship siblings, packing the same Google Tensor G3 processor that powers the high-end models. This is a huge deal for a phone priced at just €549.

The device features a 6.1-inch OLED Actua display. Finally, Google has upgraded the A-series to a 120Hz refresh rate, moving on from the 90Hz panels of the 7a. The battery is a modest 4492 mAh, which gets you through a day, though it pales in comparison to the massive 5000mAh batteries found in some Chinese competitors like the Xiaomi 13T.

Camera-wise, you get a 64MP Quad PD wide camera and a 13MP ultrawide. While it lacks the dedicated telephoto lens of the Pro model, the Super Res Zoom is surprisingly capable. It comes with 8GB of LPDDR5x RAM and starts with 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage.

It launches with Android 14 and Google promises 7 years of OS updates, which is unheard of in this price segment. For users interested in "Everyday Use" and "Photography" on a budget, this is a no-brainer.
